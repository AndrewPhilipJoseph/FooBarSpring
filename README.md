## **Initial Presentation**

| Scrum Member | Description |
|--------|-------|
| David Ramsayer | Added old [TicTacToe](https://github.com/AndrewPhilipJoseph/FooBarSpring/blob/main/src/src/Imports/TicTacToeUI.java) game to work with while learning Spring. |
| Andrew Joseph  |Created startup files (everything in the default master branch) through the use of the spring online tutorial. I also worked on setting up the online server, which is nearly done (the only remaining parts are the service files)|
